   The Tamnavulin distillery is a producer of single malt Scotch whisky that was founded in 1966.
   In 1966, Tamnavulin-Glenlivet Distillery Co. Ltd. built the Tamnavulin distillery in order to satisfy the growing demand from whisky blenders such as Whyte & Mackay, Crawfords, and Mackinlay's. In 1993, Whyte & Mackay became the owners of Tamnavulin when the company purchased Invergordon Distillers (the parent company of the Tamnavulin-Glenlivet Distillery Co. Ltd.) The purchase price of £382 million also included the distilleries Bruichladdich, Isle of Jura, and Tullibardine. The Tamnavulin distillery was closed in May 1995.

Ownership was transferred to Kyndal International in 2001, and then to the United Spirits division of United Breweries Group in 2007, operated by Whyte and Mackay Ltd. The distillery began operating once again in July 2007 after a major refurbishment with new automation and process control which was installed by Canongate Technology. Whyte and Mackay Ltd is now owned by Emperador Inc. Along with Invergordon distillery, it produces whisky for the company's blended Scotch whisky brands

   Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.

Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.

  The Balvenie distillery is a Speyside single malt Scotch whisky distillery in Dufftown, Scotland, owned by William Grant & Sons.
  William Grant was born on 19 December 1839 in his father's house in Dufftown.[citation needed] At seven he began herding cattle at a farm on the upper reaches of the River Deveron.[citation needed] He was apprenticed to a shoemaker then worked as a clerk, and then became a bookkeeper at Mortlach distillery 1866. There he was appointed as a clerk and then manager and learned the distilling trade.

After about twenty years, Grant left his job at the Mortlach distillery and bought a field near Balvenie Castle. He then drew up plans for his distillery, and the foundation stone was laid in the autumn of 1886.

   Glen Scotia distillery or sometimes affectionately known as The Scotia or Old Scotia is a distillery that is a producer of single malt Scotch whisky. The distillery was founded in 1832 in Campbeltown, Scotland.
   Campbeltown is a small town on the Kintyre Peninsula on the west coast of Scotland. It is affectionately known as the “Wee Toon”, and the Victorian Whisky Capital of the World. At its peak in the 1800s, there were 21 distilleries in this small town with approximately 170 distilleries operating at that time in the UK (129 of those in Scotland) Campbeltown still has 3 operating distilleries: Glen Scotia, Springbank, and Glengyle. These distilleries give a remarkable insight into the history of making whisky in this remote, once prolific, whisky making region of Scotland.

  The Macallan distillery is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery in Craigellachie, Moray. The Macallan Distillers Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Edrington Group, which purchased the brand from Highland Distillers in 1999.[1]

The Macallan is generally considered be the second or third highest-selling single-malt scotch, next to Glenfiddich and, by some accounts, Glenlivet.[2][3]

Originally, The Macallan was matured only in oak sherry casks brought to the distillery from Jerez, Spain. Beginning in 2004, The Macallan introduced a new main product, the Fine Oak series, with the whisky mellowed in bourbon oak casks as well as sherry ones

   Islay whisky is Scotch whisky made on Islay (/ˈaɪlə/ EYE-lə) or Ìle in Gaelic, one of the southernmost of the Inner Hebridean Islands located off the west coast of Scotland. Islay is one of five whisky distilling localities and regions in Scotland whose identity is protected by law.[1]

The three most famous brands today are Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Ardbeg.[2] In total, there are nine active distilleries on this island which measures only 25 by 15 miles (40 by 24 kilometres), and the industry is Islay's second largest employer after agriculture.[3][4] Islay is a centre of "whisky tourism", and hosts a "Festival of Malt and Music" known as Fèis Ìle each year on the last week of May, with events and tastings celebrating the cultural heritage of the island.

   Aware that building a premium image is challenging on toilet paper and bin liners alone, German discount chain Aldi branched into the world of luxury aged whisky in 2011. That November the company released 3,000 bottles of Glen Marnoch 24-year-old Highland single malt at the distinctly knock-down price of £29.99, followed by an even more rarefied 40-year-old malt called Glenbridge, at less than £50.

Since then Glen Marnoch has become the store’s proprietary luxury malt brand that has encompassed the main whisky regions, with or without an age-statement. Rumours abound as to which distilleries have been involved, and suspects have included Dalmore, Glendronach and Glen Moray.

Established in 1825, the distillery was traditionally run by three men, but now there are just two. Only eighteen casks are produced each week. They have a tour which costs £10 and currently includes two drams and a nosing glass.

The wash still has a capacity of 4200 litres and the smaller spirit still 2200 litres.

A variety of whiskies are available from the distillery. Only the Edradour 10-year is chill-filtered, a process by which the esters and oils are removed, producing a cleaner look to the whisky, which when chilled or has ice added to it does not turn cloudy. There is, amongst others, a non-chill-filtered 12-year-old malt, some of which goes into the "House of Lords" and "Clan Campbell" blends

   WhistlePig Whiskey is located on one of the oldest farms in Vermont, USA. Cultivation began here in the early 19th century in what was then known as the hamlet Shaksboro. Steam engines replaced the lifeblood of the town – a grist and lumber mill powered by the Lemon Fair River - which still meanders through farm - and the town slowly dissipated until vanishing entirely in the 1930s. The farm remained in operation until 2006 when it was purchased and renamed by WhistlePig’s founder Raj Peter Bhakta. WhistlePig Farm is being lovingly restored, a slow and painstaking process, in order to ensure that we produce the finest rye whiskey in the World.

   To honour and celebrate the courage and sacrifice of the many thousands of men and women who served their country. As the brightest and best from the fledgling Australian and New Zealand nations came together in far-flung lands, we have combined the finest aged whisky from the Dunedin Distillery, and married it with one of  Tasmania’s best known Single Malts.

  Glen Scotia Distillery was founded in 1832, and has been operating for approximately one hundred and eighty years. Situated in Campbeltown, one of the recognised 5 Whisky producing regions of Scotland, the distillery has a formidable pedigree.00

Campbeltown is a small town on the Kintyre Peninsula on the west coast of Scotland. It is affectionately known as the “Wee Toon”, and the Victorian Whisky Capital of the World. At its peak in the 1800s, there were 21 distilleries in this small town with approximately 170 distilleries operating at that time in the UK (129 of those in Scotland) Campbeltown still has 3 operating distilleries: Glen Scotia, Springbank, and Glengyle. These distilleries give a remarkable insight into the history of making whisky in this remote, once prolific, whisky making region of Scotland.

Glen Scotia was formerly known as 'Scotia' when it was first founded in 1832 by Stewart & Galbraith and Company. Stewart & Galbraith Co. ran the Distillery for almost 60 years.
